#Ensemblelearning 
An efficient Machine lerning model using ensemble techniques is made considering the Diabetes dataset available in kaggle website.The model was found to be efficient with an 80 percent accuracy.
First the dataset is looked into thoroughly.All the required preprocessing techniques are applied 
Incomplete or inconsistent data can negatively affect the outcome of data mining projects as well. To resolve such problems, the process of data preprocessing is used. There are four stages of data processing: cleaning, integration, reduction, and transformation 
After preprocessing,dataset is trained with bagging classifier,randomforest classifier,adabooost classifier,gradient bossting classifier,voting classifier
Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models.
This model helps us in predicting if the person is diabetic or not by considering the feautures like age,sex,glucose count,blood pressure,insulin,BMI etc.
The fuel economy model helps in calculating the fuel economy score of a model car based on its specifications.This machine learning model helps is choosing an efficient fuel using model car to customers
